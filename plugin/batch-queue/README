General support for cluster resource managers (RM) is provided.
Hence, its two names for the same plugin:  batch-queue and "rm".

A single plugin, libdmtcp_rm.so, supports several resource mangers.
To invoke this plugin, you should only need to use the flag '--rm':
  dmtcp_launch --rm MYAPP ARG1 ...

Currently TORQUE and SLURM resource managers are both supported.
Support for SGE and LSF is planned for the near future.

Torque is still under testing.  If you have problems with it, please write
to the authors.

Also, SLURM _especially_ is new code.  It works on some clusters, but
we have not done enough testing on the variety of clusters available.
So, you should expect that you may find some smaller bugs.  If you do,
please help us by sending feedback to the authors.  These bugs will be
fixed as we discover them.

USAGE EXAMPLES: 
  To enable DMTCP RM module you need to use the --rm option in
  dmtcp_launch.  
  Sample scripts are located in: <dmtcp-topdir>/plugin/batch-queue/job_examples.
  The examples aims to be self-descriptive.
      During debugging, it is better to start the dmtcp_coordinator in an
  interactive terminal on the front end. Refer to the example batch script
  (comment in start_coordinator() function).
