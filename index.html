<a id="about-dmtcp" class="anchor" href="#about-dmtcp" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About DMTCP:</h2>

<p>DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a tool to transparently checkpoint the state of multiple simultaneous applications, including multi-threaded and distributed applications. It operates directly on the user binary executable, without any Linux kernel modules or other kernel modifications.</p>

<p>Among the applications supported by DMTCP are Open MPI, MATLAB, R, Python, Perl, and many programming languages and shell scripting languages. DMTCP also supports <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU screen</a> sessions, including vim/cscope and emacs. With the use of TightVNC, it can also checkpoint and restart X Window applications. The OpenGL library for 3D graphics is supported through a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6650">special plugin</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp/blob/master/QUICK-START">QUICK-START</a> file for further details.</p>

<p>DMTCP supports the commonly used OFED API for InfiniBand. See <a href="https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp/blob/master/contrib/infiniband/README">contrib/infiniband/README</a> for more details.</p>

<p>[2015-03-25]: DMTCP 2.4.0-rc2 released!</p>

<p>:  This is release candidate 2 for DMTCP 2.4.0. It is especially important to upgrade if you are using any of MATLAB, MPI, SLURM or Torque; or if you have a newer Linux kernel using '[vvar]' (test with: <code>grep&amp;nbsp;'[vvar]'&amp;nbsp;/proc/self/maps</code> ); or if you use glibc-2.21 or later (test with: <code>ls&amp;nbsp;-l&amp;nbsp;/lib*/libc.so.6&amp;nbsp;/lib/*/libc.so.6</code> ).</p>

<p>[2015-03-17]: DMTCP 2.4.0-rc1 released!</p>

<p>:  This is release candidate 1 for DMTCP 2.4.0. (See above for latest release candidate.)</p>

<p>[2014-07-14]: DMTCP 2.3.1 released!</p>

<p>:  This is primarily a bug fix release.</p>

<p>[2014-07-03]: DMTCP 2.3 released!</p>

<p>:  This is primarily a bug fix release. However, if you are using DMTCP for the ARM v7 CPU, or if you are using DMTCP either with the InfiniBand network or with the SLURM batch system, then it is strongly recommended to upgrade. Check <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/news/2014/07/dmtcp-23-released"> release notes</a> for more details.</p>

<p>[2014-03-20]: DMTCP 2.2.1 released!</p>

<p>[2014-03-14]: DMTCP 2.2 released!</p>

<p>:  In this release, the lowest layers have been re-organized and partially re-written for greater clarity of code and greater maintainability. Also, users relying on the use of DMTCP with MPI, InfiniBand or the Toruqe or SLURM batch queues are strongly advised to upgrade. Check <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/news/2014/03/dmtcp-22-released"> release notes</a> for more details.</p>

<p>[2014-01-12]: DMTCP 2.1 released!</p>
